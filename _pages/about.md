### Kickstarting the Democratic Evolution 

I am **Justin Ross Gorczynski**, an **Independent** candidate for U.S. House of Representatives. 

I'm a saltwater fisherman turned web developer with a passion for technology, startups and business. I look for challenges to overcome and use adversity to fuel my ambitions in life. I grew up in Northwest Florida and attended Florida State University under full academic scholarship.

Why I am running for Congress...

### American Democracy is Broken 

Political corruption and self-serving interests have broken American democracy as it no longer represents the values of the American public. With political corruption having come to a head, now is the time for real, fundamental change. 

I have a plan...

### Technology Meets Democracy 

Building the political platform that empowers **you**. 

Using my web development and entrepreneurial prowess, I am building a web app that empowers my constituents and connects me directly to them. 

> This isn't just about representation but rather, providing a platform upon which my constituents represent themselves.

This platform implements a "localized direct democracy" component allowing direct control over pending legislation.
