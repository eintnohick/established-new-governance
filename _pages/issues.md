The cabal of corrupt politicians is absolutely disgusting.

Each argument I've seen against this movement has a proper answer. Our objective is to fix a fundamental problem and naturally we don't yet have all the answers, but we will find the answer. After all, every answer is a product of a question not having a solution. 

Is this the answer? I don't know but we absolutely owe it to ourselves to find out.

#### Democracy Lab

One possible solution is **modular policy democracy**.

#### Race Relations 
 
The “Black Lives Matter” movement is an important one that has been counterproductive and in some circumstances even destructive. We must find a solution to escalating racial tensions in America. We have to work together. 

I believe I can help the cause and would like to meet with lead organizers and Congressional Black Caucus to discuss possible solutions. 

#### Online Voting 

Online voting would be more reliable, convenient and save billions than the current pre-internet voting.


**Security and reliability:** Hacking is an over exaggerated concern. Internet security is safe enough to bank online so it's obviously safe enough. 

A combination of connected devices, IP addresses, public voter registration data and other personal information could be used to verify identity. If a large scale hacks occurs, measures would be in place to retrieve vote data. Small scale hacks simply aren't even worth the effort.

What people don't consider today is whether the vote they cast is even counted. There is no way of knowing. With online voting, you would be able to verify the submission and accuracy of your vote. 

#### Automation and the Impending Job Crisis

America, and the rest of the world, is facing an impending employment crisis.

Rapid increases in automation will all but eliminate low wage jobs. In addition to global warming, this is one of the greatest threats to global prosperity.

#### Farming for the Future

We need a new, environmentally friendly way to feed our planet. It's time for vertical farming.
