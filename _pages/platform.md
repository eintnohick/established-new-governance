#### How it Works 

The platform gives constituents unprecedented access and influence on legislative issues. I will not just act as a simple delegate but actively read, interpret and author legislation on behalf of my constituents. General oversight will be provided by me as well as come built into the platform. Here are the steps that will go into making it work:

1. Inform - Pending legislation and any relevant snippets are posted in an easy to read format. 
2. Discuss - Parse, interpret, discuss and, if necessary, formulate communication for relay. 
3. Decide - Open platform vote concluding prior to house floor vote. 
4. Vote -  House floor vote determined as directed by majority rule voters . 

#### Platform Advantages

What I bring to the congressional table is a real, tangible asset; something unprecedented. Advantages of this platform include:

- Eliminates (corruption) influence of big money in policy making
- True representation of the people
- Emphasis on individual issues rather than political parties
- Accessibility for the poor

#### Addressing Potential Issues 

Some underlying issues will need to be addressed to ensure successful implementation of the platform. These include, but are not limited to:

- **General will** - Determine how prevalent [tyranny of the masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) is in a majority rule voting system encompassing a niche demographic  (congressional district). 
- **Engagement** - The typical American just doesn't have the time or willpower to participate in daily legislative affairs. 
- **Security** - Vote-tampering and manipulation will ultimately compromise the legitimacy of any voting platform. A combination of connected devices, properly screening for eligibility, IP addresses, public voter registration data and user information will be used to thwart large-scale fraud attempts  and any small-scale fraud will simply not yield enough to be worth the effort. 

A Github repository will be set up and made available for those who would like to contribute, view and share the open source code. An initial beta platform will be released shortly after the general election.
